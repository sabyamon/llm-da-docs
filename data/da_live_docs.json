This is great for highly curated and re-used content.\nDrag and drop\nFor those that want a more friction-free approach to handling media, you can drag any supported media onto a doc. This is, by far, the easiest method to get imagery into your docs. The file will be imported into the same folder as the document.\nMedia folder\nDA provides basic media handling. If you do not have a license for AEM Assets, but wish to organize your media into a central location, we recommend using the media folder. Simply create a top-level folder called \"media\" and upload your content into it. You can open a media file, copy it to the clipboard, and paste it into your document.\n\n\nbackground\n#f1f1f1\n\n\nspacing\n1000\n\n\n\n\nContent migrations\nBecause DA simply references media, it is possible to do bulk content migrations. This could be anything from changing the source image in place to using search & replace to change a file name. Please consider the following when making these types of changes:\n\nAll changes in bulk still require a re-preview of the consuming docs so Edge Delivery Services can re-process the changed media.\nPlease note any cache constraints if changing content in AEM Assets. Ensure that you can see the changes in your publish environment before asking Edge Delivery Services to re-preview your content.\n\n\n\nbackground\n#FFF\n\n\nspacing\n1000",

    "content": "Translation, localization, and rollout\nSetup translation, localization, and rollout for DA.\n\n\n\n\n\nVocabulary\n\nTranslate - The act of taking a document in a specific language and converting it a different language.\nLocalize - Converting a document to have more locale-centric or regionally-centric content.\nRollout - The technical term for copying documents from a language folder and into a locale or region.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nDocument Authoring (DA) provides several services to help automate the translation, localization, and rollout of content. While on-demand services like Google Translate or even built-in browser translations can be convenient, they can have non-ideal SEO impacts.\nOne of the hallmark features of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is the ability to automate the process of translating, localizing, and rolling out content. In many respects, DA is no different. It provides many similar features, but with a focus on document-based authoring.\nManaging localized content at scale can be a challenge due to the amount of content that is created. DA gives you, the site owner, the freedom to be as high-touch or hands-off as needed for your project. For example: you are free to organize your site by language or by locale. You are free to auto-publish after rollout or require human authors to curate newly created content.\n\n\nStrategy\nAs we alluded to above, it's important to pick a localization strategy that fits your needs. Adobe's best practices can be read on aem.live. For our setup, we will follow the hybrid approach outlined in the best practices doc. A hybrid approach allows you to be mostly language-based, but provide affordances for locale-based content as necessary. This might be used for events in a region or used for locales where a dialect differs significantly from the source language and you have native speaking authors that can augment the translated content for the locale.\nLanguage Only\n\n/en\n/fr\n/de\n/cn\n\nLocale Only\n\n/en-us\n/en-ca\n/en-in\n/fr-fr\n/fr-ca\n/de-de\n/zh-cn\n\nHybrid\n\n/en\n/en/us\n/fr\n/fr/ca\n/de\n/de/ch\n/zh\n/zh/\n\nHigh-level considerations\nWhile a language-based approach can provide less overhead, you may run into complexities with commerce, currencies, and VAT.\nA locale-based approach may provide simplicity in commerce, but it will create undesired duplication of content that is unfriendly for SEO.\nA hybrid model where the site is predominantly language-based keeps content duplication low. You will still have similar language-based commerce considerations, but this would be considered the preferred option over locale-based.\nTranslation configuration\nBecause every site is different, DA provides a few configuration options to help you manage your content.\n\n\ntranslate.behavior - How to handle old content when new docs come back from translation.\n\noverwrite - Overwrite the old content. Useful for no-touch translation.\nmerge - Merge the old content with the new content. Useful if there is content you want to retain. This option requires human intervention after translation.\n\n\n\ntranslate.staging - Stage content in a separate area from your source content before sending to translation service.\n\non - This will copy your source content into a separate folder. This is typically done to make changes to your source docs before sending to translation but not affecting your live content.\noff - Send source documents directly to the translation service.\n\n\n\nrollout.behavior - How to handle old content when new docs get rolled out to the locale. This is only used for hybrid and locale-based localization strategies.\n\noverwrite - Overwrite the old content. Useful for no-touch translation.\nmerge - Merge the old content with the new content. Useful if there is content you want to retain. This option requires human intervention after translation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkey\nvalue\n\n\ntranslate.behavior\noverwrite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstyle\ncontainer",

It also allows you to use the DA App SDK to build rich applications that leverages any content stored on your AEM as a Cloud Service instance.\nStep 1 - AEM as a Cloud Service\nAn AEM environment config will need to be set. Details in the screenshot below. Expect a full restart (~10-20 minutes) when this is saved.\nEnvironment Configuration: ADOBE_PROVIDED_CLIENT_ID | darkalley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2 - Dark Alley\n\nVisit: https://da.live/config#/name-of-org/name-of-site/\nAdd key | value if it doesn't exist already.\nAdd aem.repositoryId | sub.youraemcloud.com\nPaper plane > Save\n\nStep 3 - Use it\n\nOpen any page and notice you have a new image icon in your toolbar. This will open a modal to your AEM Assets.\nSelect the asset you want and it will import into your document.\nThe asset must be published for DA & Edge Delivery Services to see it.\n\nUse cases\nIn addition to having all the existing benefits of AEM Assets (governance, etc.), there are a couple use cases that can be unlocked related to DA:\n\nSwapping an existing asset with an updated version.\nBulk replacing an image.\n\nIt's important to know that even if you change a single asset, if that asset is used on 1000 pages, you will need to re-preview and re-publish those 1000 pages for Edge Delivery Services to ingest the new image and update the references on aem.page and aem.live.\nUse case 1: Swap an existing asset\nUser story: As an author, I would like to update an existing asset with more vibrant colors without having to change every page the asset is currently used on.\n\nOn da.live, use the side navigation panel to navigate to your assets using the \"files\" icon.\nIn Adobe Experience Manager Assets, navigate to the folder that contains the asset you want to replace.\nReplace the asset and re-publish it.\nNavigate to a page in DA that uses the asset in question.\nDue to caching constraints, it may take up to a few minutes for the asset to update.\nOnce you can see your changes reflected, Edge Delivery is ready to ingest it. Copy the asset publish URL.\nPaste the asset publish URL into DA's search. This will list every page on DA that is using the asset.\nUse the the share button (action bar > share icon) to copy the AEM URLs.\nPaste the URLs into DA's bulk preview & publish tool (da.live/apps/bulk). Run a preview & publish on these URLs.\n\nNote: If you have staged content updates in DA that are not currently live, the bulk preview and publish tools will push these live. You will want to take the necessary steps to ensure you are not pre-maturely publishing page updates as a result of this change.",
